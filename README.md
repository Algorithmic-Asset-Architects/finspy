## ðŸ“– Abstract
In todayâ€™s digiital economy, financial institutions face increasing threats from fraudulent activities. As the volume of transactions increases, so does the sophistication of fraud attempts.  
FinSpy addresses these challenges by aggregating large-scale financial data, processing and correlating events in real-time, and leveraging advanced hybrid AI techniques to detect anomalies.  

The system integrates:
- **Machine Learning (XGBoost)** for structured fraud pattern recognition.  
- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** for adaptive learning of new fraud trends.  
- **External Threat Intelligence** such as IoCs, malware signatures, and dark-web monitoring.  

It is deployed as a **cloud-native, microservices-based platform**, capable of handling millions of events per second, ensuring scalability, regulatory compliance, and robust fraud prevention.
